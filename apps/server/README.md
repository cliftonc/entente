# @entente/server

Central Entente service providing both REST API and admin web interface. This application implements the core ContractFlow specification as a centralized contract testing service with Hono backend (Cloudflare Worker compatible) and React admin dashboard.

## Overview

The server is the heart of the Entente system, providing centralized contract management, interaction recording, fixture approval workflow, deployment tracking, and verification coordination. It implements all the ContractFlow service API endpoints and provides a modern web interface for managing the contract testing ecosystem.

## Architecture

### Backend (Hono API)
- **Framework**: Hono (Cloudflare Worker compatible)
- **Database**: Configured for Neon PostgreSQL (currently using mock data)
- **Deployment**: Both local Node.js development and Cloudflare Workers production

### Frontend (React Admin UI)
- **Framework**: React 18+ with functional components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI with custom "entente" theme
- **Layout**: Admin dashboard with left navigation and top menu bar
- **Routing**: React Router for SPA navigation

## ContractFlow API Implementation

The server implements the complete ContractFlow service API specification:

### Spec Management
- `POST /specs/:service` - Upload OpenAPI specification
- `GET /specs/:service` - Get OpenAPI specification
- `GET /specs/:service/versions` - List available versions

### Interaction Recording  
- `POST /interactions` - Record client interaction
- `GET /interactions/:service` - Get recorded interactions
- `GET /interactions/:service/stats` - Get interaction statistics

### Fixture Management
- `POST /fixtures` - Propose new fixture
- `GET /fixtures/:operation` - Get fixtures for operation
- `GET /fixtures/service/:service` - Get fixtures by service
- `GET /fixtures/pending` - Get pending fixtures
- `POST /fixtures/:id/approve` - Approve fixture
- `PUT /fixtures/:id` - Update fixture
- `DELETE /fixtures/:id` - Delete fixture

### Deployment Tracking
- `POST /deployments` - Update deployment state

### specs
- service, version, branch, environment
- spec_content (JSONB)
- uploaded_by, uploaded_at

### interactions  
- service, service_version, consumer, consumer_version
- operation, request_data, response_data (JSONB)
- environment, timestamp, duration

### fixtures
- service, service_version, operation
- status, source, priority
- data (JSONB), created_from (JSONB)
- approved_by, approved_at, notes

### deployments
- service, version, environment
- deployed_at, deployed_by, active

### verification_results
- provider, provider_version, task_id
- results (JSONB), submitted_at

## ContractFlow Specification Alignment

This server implements ContractFlow's core principles:

- **Centralized Contract Management**: Single service manages all specs, interactions, fixtures
- **Schema-First Always**: OpenAPI specs uploaded before implementation
- **Automatic Recording**: Transparent interaction capture from consumers
- **Provider Verification**: Coordinated verification against recorded interactions
- **Deployment Awareness**: Active version tracking across environments
- **CI-Only Recording**: Optimized for CI build integration
- **Fixture Approval Workflow**: Team-based fixture management

## Deployment

### Local Development
Uses Node.js with `@hono/node-server` for fast development with hot reload.

### Production (Cloudflare Workers)
Deploys as serverless Cloudflare Worker with:
- Automatic scaling and global distribution
- Neon PostgreSQL database connection
- Custom domain and SSL termination
- Edge caching for static assets

The server architecture supports both deployment models seamlessly, with environment-specific optimizations for development speed and production performance.
