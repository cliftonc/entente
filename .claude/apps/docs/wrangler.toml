# Variable bindings. These are arbitrary, plaintext strings (similar to environment variables)
# Docs:
# - https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#environment-variables
# Note: Use this to define secrets, not environment variables. For environment variables, use [env] below.
# [vars]
# MY_VARIABLE = "production_value"

# Bind a KV Namespace. Use KV as persistent storage for small key-value pairs.
# Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#kv-namespaces
# [[kv_namespaces]]
# binding = "MY_KV_NAMESPACE"
# id = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

# Bind a Durable Object. Durable objects are a scale-to-zero compute primitive based on the actor model.
# Durable Objects can live for as long as needed. Use these when you need a long-running "server", such as in realtime apps.

# [[durable_objects.bindings]]
# name = "MY_DURABLE_OBJECT"

# Bind a Queue producer. Use this binding to schedule an arbitrary task that may be processed later by a Queue consumer.
# Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#queues
# [[queues.producers]]
# binding = "MY_QUEUE"
# queue = "my-queue"

# Bind a Queue consumer. Queue Consumers can retrieve tasks scheduled by Producers to act on them.
# Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#queues
# [[queues.consumers]]
# queue = "my-queue"

# Bind an R2 Bucket. Use R2 to store arbitrarily large blobs of data, such as files.
# Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#r2-buckets
# [[r2_buckets]]
# binding = "MY_BUCKET"
# bucket_name = "my-bucket"

# Bind a hyperdrive configuration
