## What is Entente?

Entente is a modern contract testing platform that combines OpenAPI specifications with real interaction recording to provide automated contract testing between services. It helps teams build reliable APIs with confidence.

## Key Features

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="OpenAPI-First" icon="document">
		All contracts start with OpenAPI specifications, ensuring clear API definitions from the beginning.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Automatic Recording" icon="laptop">
		CI environments automatically record real interactions of a consumer against its mocks to replay against the actual provider service.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Smart Fixtures" icon="setting">
		Ability to record and store fixtures from one consumer to re-use in others, with centralised management and approval.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Real Verification" icon="approve-check">
		Providers verify against actual consumer usage, not just theoretical contracts.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Architecture

Entente follows a **TypeScript-first functional programming** approach with a **pnpm workspace** monorepo structure:

- **@entente/consumer** - Consumer testing library
- **@entente/provider** - Provider verification library
- **@entente/fixtures** - Fixture management utilities
- **@entente/cli** - Command line interface
- **@entente/server** - Central service with Hono API + React UI

You can run it yourself on **Cloudflare Workers** with **Neon PostgreSQL** for data persistence.
